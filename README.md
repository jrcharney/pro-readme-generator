Homework Challenge 9. Due December 5, 2022.

## About

In this assignment, we were to use Node.js to generate a README.md generator. Obviously, it was not used to create *this* document, but I suppose it can be used to generate the README.md file for HW 10.

This is also the first week we'll be using Node.js, which means this project might have to be hosted on Heroku rather than Github.

A few things worth noting:
* [`license`](https://nishanths.github.io/license/) is a Go Language script that automatically generates licenses for projects. Node.js's `node init` command should have this ability to do this at this point.
* [git-ignore](https://github.com/sondr3/git-ignore) should add a `git ignore` command to build `.gitignore` files. `node init`should have a similar feature. Alternately, [gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io/) (which was why the git-ignore project exists) is still around and will allow to generate a `.gitignore` file in the broswer.

These are important things to know because this project does the one thing `node init` still doesn't do: Generate a `README.md`.

## FAQ

### Wait where's 7 & 8?

Project 1 was Week 7 and 8.

### Doesn't `node init` set up a Git Repo?

Yes, but only if you allow it to. I haven't dealt with Node that much (I know, shocker!) to use it that much. Probably for the rest of this course, I will.
